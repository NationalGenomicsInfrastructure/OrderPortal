# Initial texts for the web site.
header: |
  This is a portal for placing orders. You need to have an account and
  be logged in to create, edit, submit and view orders.

footer: |
  This text should be a description of the organisation running the portal.

register: |
  Use this page to register a new account. Your email address is the account
  name in this portal.

  The administrator of the portal will view your account details and if
  everything seems fine, the account will be enabled.

  You will receive an email with a link to a page for setting the password
  when the account is enabled.

reset: |
  Use this page to reset your password. You will not be able to login once
  this has been done.

  An email with a link to a page for setting a new password will be sent
  to you. This contains a one-time code. If you loose this code, simply use
  this page again, and a new code will be sent.

password: |
  Set the password for your account. You need the one-time code which was
  contained in the URL sent to you by email. If the code has been used or
  lost, go to [the reset page](/reset) to obtain a new code.

help_datatypes: |
  An input field must have a data type, which determines what values are
  considered valid for the field. The types are:

  - **string**: A string of characters. Intended for one-line text input.
  - **integer**: A valid integer value, e.g. 12, -39 or 1098009.
  - **float**: A valid floating point value, e.g. 1.0, 3.141 or 9.1e10.
  - **boolean**: A logical value of either "true" or "false". Shown as a dropdown menu.
  - **url**: A value that looks like a URL; no check is made that it actually is reachable.
  - **select**: A selection of predefined string values. The values are specificed in the field edit page.
  - **text**: A string of characters spanning more than one line.
  - **date**: A valid date. Shown as a date selection widget.
  - **group**: A group of fields. Does not contain any value of its own.

admin_tutorial: |
  For an end-user to create an order, the admin will have to prepare a form.
  Like this:

  - Go to the [forms list page](/forms).
  - Click the button "Create form".
  - Fill in the title and description. These can be edited later.
  - Click "Save".

  Now add fields. A "group" field is a container for other fields, and does
  not contain a value of its own. The other types of fields are pretty
  self-explanatory.

  - Click "Create field".
  - Choose group. If no groups have been created, only the top level is
    available. This choice cannot be edited.
  - The identifier must be like a common programming language identifier:
    Begin with an alphabetical character, and then any number of alphanumerical
    and underscore characters. No blanks. It must be unique within the form.
    (We should agree on a convention for common fields in many forms here.)
  - The label is what is shown for the user. If none, then the identifer will
    be shown, somewhat prettified. Can be edited later.
  - The field can be made read-only for user, or invisible to the user.
  - The description is the help text visible to the user. Can be edited later.
  - Click "Save."
  - The field will be added below the others in its group. The placement in
    the group can be edited later.
  - If you make a mistake (giving wrong identifier, placing in wrong group,
    etc) you will probably have to delete the field and try again. Currently,
    only the label, access, placement and description can be edited later.
  - Conditional visibility is specified when editing a field. Currently,
    only a single value in another select field can be tested against.

  After having added some fields, it is possible to test what an order for it
  will look like: Click "Testing". This will allow only admins to create and
  edit orders for the form.

  Once done with testing, click "Pending" to allow editing of the form again.
  Any orders created while "Testing" will automatically be deleted.

  **Do not click "Enable"!** That will enable the form for users to create
  orders. This **cannot be undone!** So be sure that the form is OK before
  you do this.

  Currently, the site is in test mode. All forms and orders will be erased
  before going into production mode, so go wild.
