OrderPortal
===========

A portal for orders (_a.k.a._ requests, project applications) to one
single facility from its users. The order form fields are fully
configurable via the web interface. The field definitions are generic,
and allow order forms to be designed for a wide variety of facilities.

The OrderPortal system can be used for several facilities within the
same organisation by running several completely separate
instances. The current design sets up user accounts for each instance
separately, using email address as the user account identifier. We
decided against a database design involving a single user account
database for all facilities, for conceptual simplicity. This decision
may be revisited in the future.

The design of the order form setup is fairly general; there is nothing
that is hardcoded for scientific or genomics data _per se_. The form
content is easy to change via the web interface. Previously submitted
orders are not affected by such changes. A mechanism to also update
older orders by changes to the current form fields is being
considered, but has not been designed or implemented yet.

We are striving to keep the design as flexible and general as
possible. The base template and CSS are to some extend modifiable (via
command line operations), allowing the appearance of the OrderPortal
to be customised.

The OrderPortal system was originally created to satisfy the needs of
a lab facility which produces sequence data from DNA and RNA samples
provided by external researchers. The facility processes the samples
according to the order from the scientist.

Only orders, no info pages
--------------------------

The system is minimalistic in the sense that it handles only
orders. There is no general wiki or blog function for describing the
context of the orders. Such needs must be handled by other systems.

Facility
--------

The term facility is used for the organisation providing the service
specified by the order form. One instance (database) of the system
handles one facility. All entities in the database belong to one and
only one facility.

There are two reasons for this design choice:

1. Security between facilities. The existence and contents of a
   particular project in one facility must not be visible to the
   administrators or staff of another facility. This is a strict
   requirement for some facilities, and it is easier to implement if
   the databases for each facility is separate from one another.

2. The styling of an order portal is much easier to implement if each
   facility has its own portal instance.

One drawback with this design choice is that it does not allow the
users to see all their orders in all facilities within the system.


Users
-----

A user is an account in the system. Almost all operation require that
the user is logged in.

There are basically three kinds of users:

1. User: An external scientist, who uses the portal to place one or
   more orders, and to follow the progress of their own orders. The
   "customer" of the facility.

2. Staff: Facility staff, who may view all orders.

3. Admin: System administrators, who are allowed to view and edit all
   aspects of the system that can be modified via the web
   interface. This includes processing orders, modifying the order
   fields, and handling user accounts.

User accounts can be set as disabled, for example if the person leaves
her position, or as a means of blocking invalid use. Deletion of a
user account is not allowed, to allow full traceability of old
orders. An account can always be enabled again.

An external scientist applies for a user account by providing the
relevant information. Such an account is created with a status of
"pending".  The administrator reviews the pending user account and
enables it if it appears legitimate. The user gets an email about the
account having been enabled and with instructions on how to set the
password for it.


Access privileges
-----------------

The user can place orders as soon has she has logged in.

A user is allowed to specify which other users will be able to access
to her orders. Access can also be granted to specific users for each
individual order.


Order: form and fields
----------------------

The administrator designs the set of fields which are to be filled in
by the user for an order. This involves the following parameters for a
field:

- Field identifier
- Field data type
- Is a field value required?
- Field description
- Value options, if relevant
- Hierarchy and order, including conditional visibility
- Visibility to the user

When an order is created, its fields definitions are copied from the
current set. Thus, an order is always self-contained. The set of
fields defined for the site may change, but the structure of the order
stays the same. This allows any change of the current set of fields,
while maintaining the integrity of old orders. The disadvantage is
that it makes it hard to update old orders with any new fields.

A field may be conditional, meaning that it is displayed only of some
other field has been assigned a specific value. This is necessary for
orders where the relevant fields depend on some high-level choice,
such a type of technology to use for a project.

The data in all dependent fields deselected by a choice in a
high-level conditional field should be set as undetermined when the
order is saved by the user. This simplifies interpretation of the
order data by other external systems.

Once an order has been created, its fields and selected options are
effectively frozen, and remain fixed even if the current fields are updated.

Order
-----

An order is a copy of all fields at the time of its creation. It
belongs to a user. It is editable by the user until it has been
submitted for approval by the facility staff.

An order may contain fields which require a value. An order lacking a
required value can be saved, but it cannot be submitted. This allows
the user to create and fill in orders only partially, and to return to
the order at a later date to complete it.

An order can have one and only one state. The following is the list
of standard states:

| State       | Semantics                                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| PREPARATION | Created, and possibly edited.                        |
| SUBMITTED   | Submitted by user.                                   |
| REVIEW      | Under review by the facility.                        |
| ACCEPTED    | Checked and accepted by the facility.                |
| REJECTED    | Rejected by facility.                                |
| PENDING     | Awaiting further input from user.                    |
| QUEUED      | Facility has placed the order in its work queue.     |
| WORKING     | Work is on-going, in the lab or in data analysis.    |
| WAITING     | Work has paused, for whatever reason.                |
| CANCELLED   | Project stopped by the user.                         |
| ABORTED     | Project stopped by the facility.                     |
| FINISHED    | Work has been finalized.                             |
| DELIVERED   | The results have been delivered to the user.         |
| INVOICED    | The user has been invoiced.                          |
| CLOSED      | All work and steps for the order have been done.     |
| ARCHIVED    | The order has been archived; cannot be changed.      |

The states and allowed transitions are defined in a YAML configuration
file for a facility. This allows a facility to define other states and
transitions than the standard ones. It also allows new states and
transitions to be added to an existing setup. Removing existing states
may break the system, and should not be attempted; instead, the transitions
should be modified to avoid the redundant state.

Publications
------------

The system should include a feature to allow facility coordinators
and/or users to curate a list of publication references associated
with the user, and possibly the order.

This will be of help when preparing reports for the grant review of a
facility.

Interface
---------

There are two main interfaces to the system, the web and the API. The
web interface behaves differently depending on the type of the user
account logged in.

### User web interface

This is for human users. It should provide the user with sufficient
help and visual cues to allow filling in the form in a productive
manner. Missing values and values outside of allowed ranges must be
highlighted to help the user prepare a valid order.

### Staff web interface

This is for normal facility staff usage. Display of orders according
to state and other parameters.

### System administration web interface

For administrators only, this interface enables editing orders, users
and fields. This includes the ability to move orders along into
different states.

### The Application Programming Interface (API)

The API allows other systems to interact with the order portal. It is
based on RESTful principles using JSON and linked data to allow other
systems to access and/or modify various data entities in the portal.

Additional information
----------------------

Once an order has been submitted, additional information may be
required from the user. For example, a sample information sheet may be
requested by the facility. The facility should be able to specify a
form for this, which should handle Excel and CSV files up- and
download.

Attached files
--------------

Files such as agreements, specifications, images, etc, can be attached
to an order or to a sample. Both users and facility staff should be
allowed to do this.

Links
-----

Links to other web pages can be set for orders and samples, allowing
users to navigate to other relevant information systems. Both facility
staff and users should be able to set this.

Status
------

The system should allow display of a status page, in which the current
state of the project corresponding to the order is provided to the
user. The content of this page is extracted from other systems such as
the LIMS of the laboratory.

Log
---

Each change of an order is logged, and the information "who, when,
what" is stored. The log trace is written by the system automatically
and cannot be edited by any user.
