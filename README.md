OrderPortal
===========

A portal for orders (= requests, project applications) for one or more
facilities, where the available services may vary over time.

This system was designed to satisfy the needs of a scientific
infrastructure for producing DNA sequence data from biological
samples. The samples are provided by external researchers. The
infrastructure facility processes the samples according to the order
from the scientist, and returns the resulting data and metadata.

The design of the order form setup is such that this software system
should be applicable to other areas; there is nothing that is
hardcoded for scientific or genomics facilities.
